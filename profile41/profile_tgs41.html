                John Winston Ono Lennon[nb 1] (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 â€“ 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, musician and peace activist[2]
                 who achieved worldwide fame as the founder, co-songwriter, co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. He was characterised for the rebellious nature
                  and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.[3]

                Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960.
                 He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. In the mid-1960s, he authored two books: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works,
                 both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967's "All You Need Is Love", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.
                 In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono, and held the two week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-Ins for Peace. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued
                  his music career as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.
